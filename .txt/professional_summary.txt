I have a longstanding love for aerospace and autonomous and remotely operated systems. After earning my bachelor’s degree in CS with a certificate and focus in Unmanned Vehicle Systems, I have gained experience wearing many software-oriented hats in the aerospace industry, from robotic manufacturing to embedded flight software to full-stack ground systems and simulation frameworks.

My professional experience includes different roles across the aerospace industry. After an internship at Lockheed Martin where I developed devops tools and robotics manufacturing software on the F-35 and Patriot PAC-3 programs, I moved to Southern California to work at Terran Orbital as a Flight Software Engineer. While at Terran, I developed drivers for customer payloads as well as getting my first experience in mission operations, working in mission control for the LunIR satellite launched to the Moon aboard SLS. I also developed systems and software for managing Terran’s extensive roster of hardware and software testing platforms, organizing those tools for the first time since the company’s inception.

At Turion Space, I wore many hats, as happens at hard tech startups. I wrote embedded C/C++ flight software for DROID.001, the first dedicated space-to-space commercial imagery satellite, and worked satellite mission operations for it as both Mission Operator and Flight Director. I had a large hand in developing our web-based mission control software (Ruby on Rails) and deploying it on AWS servers. After commissioning DROID.001, I developed ground infrastructure, from full-stack portals and database/backend suites on cloud resources in TypeScript and Go, to single-handedly developing Turion’s in-house ESCHATOS spacecraft dynamics simulation framework from scratch in Python. If software touched the vehicle or its operations, I helped build it.
