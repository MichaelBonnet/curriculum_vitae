My résumé and professional summary, available in both plaintext and markdown file formats.

In `./markdown`, my résumé (`resume.md`) can be found, with each component of the resume also present as a separate file. Also present is my long-form professional summary in `professional_summary.md`. If you click on individual `.md` files, GitHub will show it to you formatted.

In `./plaintext`, my résumé (`resume.txt`) can be found, with each component of the resume also present as a separate file. Also present is my long-form professional summary in `professional_summary.txt`.
