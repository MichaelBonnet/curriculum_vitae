# Michael Bonnet

## EDUCATION

University of Texas at Arlington
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, May 2022
* For senior project, led a six-engineer team in the design, construction, and demonstration of a hexacopter UAV system that delivers a radio-controlled penetration testing platform - a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux - to the vicinity of a target network. The operator then directs the penetration testing Raspberry Pi to scan the target network for vulnerabilities and exploit any that are found.
* Coursework: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Unmanned Vehicle Systems, Data Structures & Algorithms, RF Engineering, Software Engineering, C, C++, Java, ARM Assembly

University of Texas at Arlington
Certificate in Unmanned Vehicle Systems, May 2022
* Graduated with CSE Department's Certificate in Unmanned Vehicle Systems, a multi-course track covering unmanned vehicle system theory and design (including UGVs and UASs/UAVs) as well as extensive study of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
* Coursework: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Intro to Unmanned Vehicle Systems, Unmanned Vehicle Systems Design

* Operated DROID.001 spacecraft as Mission Operator and Flight Director throughout launch and early orbit phase
* Built Turion Space's proprietary STARFIRE API in Go using the Echo framework and a Postgres SQL database for cataloguing and distributing orbital space domain awareness data, deploying to AWS
* Developed ESCHATOS Turion Space's internal spacecraft dynamics simulation library, enabling safe operation of a constellation of near-real-time space-to-space photoreconnaisance satellites
* Implemented astrodynamics and astronomical algorithms in a library for widespread internal company use in Python and Golang

### Flight Software Engineer @ Terran Orbital
Irvine, CA - May 2022-January 2023
* Configured custom Linux-based operating systems for NASA Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator satellites in low-earth orbit and for customers using Terran Orbital-designed satellites for their own missions
* Designed, developed, and tested performant C++ embedded software for projects totaling dozens of spacecraft
* Supported launches of company and customer payloads to low-earth orbit (LEO) and translunar trajectories with flight software troubleshooting both in mission control and on call

### Software Engineer Intern @ Lockheed Martin
Fort Worth, TX
May 2021-May 2022
* Implemented novel software controlling 6 DOF robotic arms used in manufacturing Patriot missile and F-35 parts
* Developed practices and documentation for properly using Git version control within an Agile (Scrum) development cycle, earning opportunity to continue working past the summer internship

### Software Development Intern @ MineralWare
Fort Worth, TX - January 2020-May 2020
* Successfully completed a semester-long internship, earning the trust and respectof my team and supervisors while working in an Agile development cycle
* Worked in Zope framework on the MineralWare web application using skills in HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Ajax, and SQL
* Overhauled all styles for the entire MineralWare application
* Redesigned the client-facing Tract Management page
* Implemented a system to automatically update static resources in the Mineral-Ware application upon release of new versions, solving a common client issue

## PROJECTS

### Project AAPI - Penetration Testing Drone
* UT Arlington Senior Design capstone project to create a drone that carries a penetration testing payload in the form of a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux.
* The payload, controlled and communicated with via RF signals, identifies open Wireless Access Points, then scans the network behind the access point and exploits any vulnerabilities found.
* Served as Team Leader, Scrum Master, and Communications Lead on a team of six total engineering students.
* Sponsored by Elbit Systems of America (ESA) as well as the Department of Computer Science & Engineering.
* Advised by Dr. Christopher McMurrough and ESA's Rick Plumer.

### Autonomous LEGO EV3 Robots
* UT Arlington Autonomous Robots course team projects that I completed along with teammates Allison Gardiner and Noah Walker.
* Robot 1, ”Solomon”, solved a painter’s tape-demarcated maze with known configuration, starting point, and goal point using A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic
* Robot 2, ”Rehoboam”, using color and ultrasonic sensors, solved a similar maze with unknown initial position or maze configuration, with the goal of finding an object in the maze and pushing it out of position
* Robots 3-6, "Babylon I, II, III, & IV", implemented the four behaviors of Braitenberg Vehicles, changing their velocity and heading based on where they perceive "light" signals to be coming from via ultrasonic and IR sensors.
