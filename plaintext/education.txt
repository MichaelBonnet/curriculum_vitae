EDUCATION

University of Texas at Arlington
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, May 2022
* For senior capstone, led a six-engineer team in the design, construction, and demonstration of a hexacopter UAV system that delivers a radio-controlled penetration testing platform - a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux and carrying a civilian radio chip - to the vicinity of a target network. The operator then directs the penetration testing Raspberry Pi to autonomously scan the target network for vulnerabilities and exploit any that are found.
* Coursework: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Unmanned Vehicle Systems, Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Engineering, Embedded Systems, C, C++, Java, ARMv7 Assembly
