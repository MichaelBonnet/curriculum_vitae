EDUCATION

University of Texas at Arlington
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, May 2022
* For senior capstone, led a six-engineer team in the design, construction, and demonstration of a hexacopter UAV system that delivers a radio-controlled penetration testing platform - a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux and carrying a civilian radio chip - to the vicinity of a target network. The operator then directs the penetration testing Raspberry Pi to autonomously scan the target network for vulnerabilities and exploit any that are found.

* Configured custom Linux-based operating systems for NASA Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator satellites in low-earth orbit and for customers using Terran Orbital-designed satellites for their own missions
* Designed, developed, and tested performant C++ embedded software for projects totaling dozens of spacecraft
* Supported launches of company and customer payloads to low-earth orbit (LEO) and translunar trajectories with flight software troubleshooting both in mission control and on call

Software Engineer Intern @ Lockheed Martin
Fort Worth, TX
May 2021-May 2022
* Implemented novel software controlling 6 DOF robotic arms used in manufacturing Patriot missile and F-35 parts
* Developed practices and documentation for properly using Git version control within an Agile (Scrum) development cycle, earning opportunity to continue working past the summer internship

Software Development Intern @ MineralWare
Fort Worth, TX - January 2020-May 2020
* Successfully completed a semester-long internship, earning the trust and respectof my team and supervisors while working in an Agile development cycle
* Worked in Zope framework on the MineralWare web application using skills in HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Ajax, and SQL
* Overhauled all styles for the entire MineralWare application
* Redesigned the client-facing Tract Management page
* Implemented a system to automatically update static resources in the Mineral-Ware application upon release of new versions, solving a common client issue

PROJECTS

Project AAPI - Penetration Testing Drone
* UT Arlington Senior Design capstone project to create a drone that carries a penetration testing payload in the form of a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux.
* The payload, controlled and communicated with via RF signals, identifies open Wireless Access Points, then scans the network behind the access point and exploits any vulnerabilities found.
* Served as Team Leader, Scrum Master, and Communications Lead on a team of six total engineering students.
* Sponsored by Elbit Systems of America (ESA) as well as the Department of Computer Science & Engineering.
* Advised by Dr. Christopher McMurrough and ESA's Rick Plumer.

Autonomous LEGO EV3 Robots
* UT Arlington Autonomous Robots course team projects that I completed along with teammates Allison Gardiner and Noah Walker.
* Robot 1, ”Solomon”, solved a painter’s tape-demarcated maze with known configuration, starting point, and goal point using A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic
* Robot 2, ”Rehoboam”, using color and ultrasonic sensors, solved a similar maze with unknown initial position or maze configuration, with the goal of finding an object in the maze and pushing it out of position
* Robots 3-6, "Babylon I, II, III, & IV", implemented the four behaviors of Braitenberg Vehicles, changing their velocity and heading based on where they perceive "light" signals to be coming from via ultrasonic and IR sensors.

OTHER PROFESSIONAL WORK

Volunteer Educator @ Prison Education Project
Los Angeles, CA - September 2024-Present
* Taught "Introduction to College Success" to incarcerated minors in the Los Angeles County Probation Juvenile Hall system
* Encouraged reform and education success in students, leading to success on the outside and reduced recidivism
